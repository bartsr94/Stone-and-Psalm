## Known Gaps / Blockers

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| **Greybox kit not chosen** | Blocks task 0.7. Kenney's medieval/survival packs are the leading candidate (CC0). Needs a licence check and a look at whether the massing suits an abbey. |
| **No Blender pipeline verified** | The `.glb` → Godot round-trip with a vertex-colour attribute named `Col` is assumed, not tested. Verify with one throwaway cube **before** Phase 1's material work. |
| **Valley heightmap authoring method undecided** | Handcrafted, but by what tool — Godot terrain plugin, Blender sculpt, or a hand-painted heightmap PNG? Decide in Phase 1. |
| **Liturgical calendar data not authored** | `liturgical_calendar.json` needs real feast dates. Phase 3 blocker, not Phase 0. |
| **Performance of 250 agents unproven** | Assumed fine with one material and no `MultiMesh`. Profile at Phase 4 before committing (Architecture Guide §5). |

## Decision Log

### 2026-09-04 — Project founded

New project. Goal: **learn 3D and the visual side of game development**, following the Pirates
of the Misty Isles pivot which traded that goal away in favour of a 2.5D pixel-art pipeline.

Concept: a *Banished*-style monastery builder with *Anno*-depth production chains and a *Name of
the Rose* institutional layer.

### 2026-09-04 — Historical setting, not Palusteria

**Considered and rejected:** setting the game in the established Palusteria universe, reusing the
1,305-line Solar Church of Imani lore from The Trading Post — which already contains six named
religious orders, a doctrinal schism, an Inquisition, and an existing "Port Iron Monastery".
That would have been a large amount of free, portfolio-connected content.

**Chosen instead:** real history — Catholic monastic orders, a Yorkshire dale, c. 1132–1348.

Rationale:

1. **The stated intent was to do historical work** rather than the usual fantasy/sci-fi.
2. **Ground truth for the 3D learning goal.** Fontenay, Fountains, Rievaulx, Le Thoronet and
   Tintern give thousands of reference photographs and measured drawings. For a project whose
   entire purpose is learning to make things look right, not having to *invent* what a chapter
   house looks like is worth more than pre-written lore.
3. **The real orders differ more than invented ones would.** Cistercian vs. Cluniac is a genuine
   historical argument about how a day should be spent — which maps directly onto the core loop.
4. Public-domain primary sources: the Rule of St Benedict, the Plan of St Gall, the *Carta
   Caritatis*, Pegolotti's wool tables.

**Cost accepted:** no reuse of the Palusteria lore, and no portfolio interconnection with The
Trading Post / Ashmark Chronicles / Palusteria Nights. The Solar Church material stays where it
is and is not migrated.

**New risk introduced:** research becoming the project. Mitigated by the research rule in
`CLAUDE.md` — research must produce a building, a chain, a number, or a named event.

### 2026-09-04 — Yorkshire over Burgundy or Poland

Burgundy (Cîteaux, Cluny, Fontenay intact) and Polish foundations (Tyniec 1044, Jędrzejów 1140)
were both considered. Yorkshire chosen for: the post-Harrying "found a house in the waste" being
literal history, the wool economy, locally available lead/iron/limestone completing every chain
without imports, the 54°N daylight swing that drives the core mechanic, and a climate palette
that matches the *Banished* visual target.

### 2026-09-04 — The Fundamental Rule adapted: position is authoritative

Unlike Pirates of the Misty Isles, where agent position is transient because modes discard it,
this is one persistent world. A monk carrying goods across the precinct is real state that must
survive a save and be reasoned about headlessly.

**Logical position (`grid_pos`, `path`, `carrying`) is therefore authoritative here**; only the
interpolated `Vector3` and animation state are transient. Documented in Architecture Guide §2 and
§12. This is a deliberate deviation, not drift.

### 2026-09-04 — Visual-first roadmap ordering

The roadmap deliberately inverts this portfolio's usual sim-first instinct. Phases 1–3 deliver a
lit, seasonal 3D valley with a monk walking by the Divine Office **before any production chain
exists**, and every phase carries a screenshot or clip as an exit criterion.

This is a direct countermeasure to the documented portfolio failure mode (Star Routes: 134 tests,
ten systems, zero rendering; Frontiers Unknown: 1251 tests, paused at polish) — a risk that is
unusually high here because `SIMULATION_SPEC.md` is deep and headless work is tempting.

### 2026-09-04 — Vertex colours over textures

One shared vertex-colour material plus a small palette texture, rather than per-model UV
unwrapping and texturing. Chosen to skip the single largest time sink in a first 3D project, and
because a fixed palette produces visual coherence by construction rather than by discipline.

Recorded as a decision because reversing it later means remaking every asset.

## Open Questions

Design questions with placeholders in force: `docs/GDD_STONE_AND_PSALM.md` §14 and
`docs/SIMULATION_SPEC.md` §22. Placeholders are deliberately concrete so implementation is never
blocked waiting on a decision.

The two worth revisiting early:

| # | Question | Placeholder | Revisit at |
|---|---|---|---|
| GDD 5 | Are all five orders in v1? | **No — Cistercian and Benedictine only.** | Phase 7 |
| Sim 6 | Books as individual objects or a library number? | **Individual objects.** Costly but it's the *Name of the Rose* hook. | Phase 10 |
